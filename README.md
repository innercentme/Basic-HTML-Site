# Basic-HTML-Site
A basic website created using only HTML is a simple but functional tool for putting web content on the Internet. Using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), you can create the structure of a web page, display text content, images, and links.

The main idea of HTML is to describe the structure and content of a web page using various elements and tags. You can use headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and links to create informational content for your website.
